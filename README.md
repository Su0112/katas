# katas

#kata 1:
Some of the following katas deal with arrays and looping! If you're having some trouble completing these, you might find it helpful to visit some of the exercises, such as "Looping and Repetition","Array Operations and Properties", and "Looping Over Arrays". JavaScript does have some built-in helper functions for working with arrays such as .sort, .map, .filter, and others, but we highly recommend avoiding those functions while working through the katas.

In the kata1 exercise, we will be given an array of 2 or more numbers. We will then have to find the two largest numbers in that array, and sum them together.

JavaScript does have some built-in helper functions for working with arrays such as .sort, .map, .filter, and others, but we highly recommend avoiding those functions while working through the prep katas.

For kata2, we'll be adding only the numbers in the array which match the given condition.

#kata 3:
In this exercise, we will be counting the number of vowels that appear in a given string. For this exercise, consider the following to be vowels: a, e, i, o, and u.

#kata 4:
In this exercise, we will be given a list of instructors and have to determine which instructor has the longest name.

#kata 5:
In this exercise, we will be given a normal string of words and turn it into a percent-encoded string by replacing all whitespace with %20.
Percent Encoding
If we want to add a parameter to a url, there are certain characters that must be encoded in order to make the URL valid. There are many characters that must be encoded, including: , !, ", and #. For this exercise, we will only be focusing on replacing the space with %20.

#kata 6:
We need to write a function called whereCanIPark() that returns the coordinates of an available parking spot for the vehicle, or returns false if there is no available spot. Our function receives an array of arrays representing parking spots, and a string with type of the vehicle that is looking for a parking spot.
